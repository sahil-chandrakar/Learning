IMPORTANT POINTS
---------------

Events are actions happening in the browser (click, input, submit, keypress, scroll, change, etc.).

JS handles events using addEventListener(eventType, callback).

One element can have multiple listeners for the same event.

Inline events like <button onclick="fn()"> are not recommended.

Common event categories:

Mouse: click, dblclick, contextmenu, mouseover, mouseout

Keyboard: keydown, keyup, keypress

Form: input, change, submit, focus, blur

Window: load, scroll, resize

event.target → the actual element that triggered the event.

event.currentTarget → the element on which the listener is attached.

To prevent default browser action (form submit, link open):
→ event.preventDefault()

Events help create interactivity like buttons, forms, lists, modals, dropdowns, tabs, etc.



Event Bubbling – Simple Definition
-------------

When an event triggers on a child, it automatically moves upward to its parent elements until the root.

Stop event from moving up:
event.stopPropagation();


Stop bubbling + stop other listeners on the same element:
event.stopImmediatePropagation();

Event Delegation (IMP)
---------------
👉 Instead of adding event listeners to many child elements, you add one event listener to the parent, and handle all child clicks from that one listener.

Example: 
❌ Without delegation (BAD)

Adding listener to every child button:

document.querySelectorAll(".btn").forEach(btn => {
  btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  });
});


If 100 buttons → 100 listeners 😬

✅ With delegation (GOOD)

Attach only one listener to the parent:

document.querySelector(".parent").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  if (e.target.matches(".btn")) {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  }
});


Even if 100 buttons → still only 1 listener 🤝
Even if new buttons are added later → it still works automatically.
