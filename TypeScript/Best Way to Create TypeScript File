Follow the steps and copy the files — you’ll be running in minutes.

1) Prereqs

Node.js + npm installed. (If not, install from nodejs.org)

A code editor (VS Code — looks like you already have it).

Basic comfort with terminal/commands.

2) Project setup (commands)

Run these in your project root (where index.html is):

# initialize npm
npm init -y

# install TypeScript compiler and a tiny dev server
npm install --save-dev typescript lite-server

# create src folder for ts files
mkdir src

3) Create tsconfig.json

Create tsconfig.json in project root (this tells tsc where to read and write):

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "ES2015",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "./assets/js",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}


Notes:

rootDir: src — put your .ts files in src/.

outDir: assets/js — compiled .js will land in assets/js, matching your structure.

4) package.json scripts

Open package.json and add scripts section (or replace scripts):

"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "watch": "tsc -w",
  "start": "lite-server"
}


npm run build — compiles TypeScript once.

npm run watch — recompiles on changes.

npm run start — serves your project on a local server (so fetch and routing behave normally).

5) create files app.ts, index.html etc

6) Build & run

In terminal:

# build TypeScript once
npm run build

# start dev server (serves your index.html)
npm run start


Open the address printed by lite-server (usually http://localhost:3000) and test a city.

If you're actively developing, run:

npm run watch
# and in another terminal
npm run start
